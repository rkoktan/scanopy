## 📚 Documentation

- **[Installation Guide](./docs/INSTALLATION.md)** - Detailed setup instructions for all platforms
- **[User Guide](./docs/USER_GUIDE.md)** - Complete guide to using Scanopy features
- **[Configuration Reference](./docs/CONFIGURATION.md)** - Server, daemon, and environment variables
- **[Architecture Overview](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - System design and technology stack

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Server**: Docker and Docker Compose
- **Daemon** (included in default setup): Docker with host networking, or standalone binary

### Installation

1. **Start the server** (includes integrated daemon):

    **Docker Compose**
    
    ```bash
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scanopy/scanopy/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml && docker compose up -d
    ```
    
    **Proxmox**
    
    You can use this [helper script](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=scanopy) to create a Scanopy LXC on your Proxmox host.
    
    **Unraid**
    
    Scanopy is available as an Unraid community app.

2. **Access the UI** at `http://<your-server-ip>:60072`

3. **Create your account** on the registration page

4. **Wait for first discovery** to complete (5-10+ minutes depending on network size)

That's it! Scanopy automatically:
- Creates a default network
- Starts the integrated daemon
- Runs initial discovery
- Schedules daily scans

### Next Steps

- **View your topology**: Navigate to Topology to see the network diagram
- **Scan additional VLANs**: Deploy more daemons at **Manage > Daemons** or add subnets to your existing daemon's scan list in **Discover > Scheduled**
- **Organize your network**: Create groups, consolidate hosts, manage subnets

See the [User Guide](./docs/USER_GUIDE.md) for detailed feature documentation.

## 📋 FAQ

**Can I run Scanopy without Docker?**

The server requires Docker (or manual PostgreSQL + Rust + Node.js setup for development). The daemon is available as a standalone binary for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

**How do I scan multiple VLANs?**

Deploy multiple daemons—one per VLAN you want to scan. Each daemon connects to the server and discovers its local network segment. See [Multi-VLAN Setup](USER_GUIDE.md#multi-vlan-setup) in the User Guide.

**Is IPv6 supported?**

Not currently. IPv6 support is planned for displaying IPv6 addresses and connectivity testing, but not full subnet scanning. See [User Guide FAQ](USER_GUIDE.md#faq) for details.

**How long does discovery take?**

Typically 5-10+ minutes depending on network size, subnet masks, and concurrent scan settings. Monitor progress in **Discover > Sessions**.

**Can I customize the topology layout?**

Yes! Extensive customization options including network filters, service category hiding, Docker grouping, edge type filters, manual node positioning, and subnet resizing. See [Topology Visualization](USER_GUIDE.md#topology-visualization).
