## Networks

Networks are the primary organizational unit in NetVisor. Each network represents a distinct environment with its own hosts, services, and topology.

### What Networks Are For

- Separating production, staging, and home environments
- Organizing networks by physical location
- Managing multi-tenant deployments
- Grouping related infrastructure

### Network Properties

- **Name**: Display name for the network
- **Description**: Optional notes about the network's purpose
- **Daemons**: Which daemons scan this network
- **Hosts**: Number of discovered hosts
- **Services**: Number of detected services

### Managing Networks

**Creating a network**:
1. Navigate to **Manage > Networks**
2. Click **"Create Network"**
3. Enter name and optional description
4. Deploy a daemon to scan it

**Switching networks**: Networks are selected via the topology options panel or when creating discoveries.

**Deleting a network**: Click the delete icon on the network card. This removes all associated hosts, services, and topology data.

<p align="center">
  <img src="../media/networks_tab.png" width="800" alt="Networks Tab">
</p>

## Hosts

Hosts represent physical or virtual devices on your network. They are automatically discovered during network scans.

### Host Properties

- **IP Addresses**: All network interfaces
- **MAC Addresses**: Hardware addresses for each interface
- **Interfaces**: Network connections and subnet membership
- **Services**: Services running on the host
- **Virtualization**: Container or VM relationships (if detected)

### Managing Hosts

**Viewing hosts**:
- Navigate to **Manage > Hosts**
- Filter by network, service type, or search
- Click a host to see detailed information

**Editing a host**:
1. Click on a host card
2. Modify properties in the detail panel
3. Add/remove interfaces or services
4. Save changes

**Creating a host manually**:

**Deleting a host**: Click the delete icon. This removes the host and all its interfaces and services.

<p align="center">
  <img src="../media/hosts_tab.png" width="800" alt="Hosts Tab">
</p>

### Consolidating Hosts

When a device appears on multiple VLANs or through different discovery methods, it may be discovered as separate hosts. Use consolidation to merge them.

**How to consolidate**:
1. Select a host to keep (primary)
2. Click **"Consolidate"**
3. Select the duplicate host(s) to merge
4. Review the consolidated result
5. Confirm the merge

The primary host will gain all interfaces, services, and properties from the merged hosts.

### Host Virtualization

If a host runs Proxmox or Docker, NetVisor tracks which VMs or containers run on it.

**Virtualization managers detected**:
- **Proxmox**: Links VMs and LXC containers to the Proxmox service running on the host
- **Docker**: Links containers to the Docker service running on the host

This relationship is displayed in the topology and host details.

**Deleting a subnet**: Click the delete icon. Hosts on the subnet remain but lose subnet association.

<p align="center">
  <img src="../media/subnets_tab.png" width="800" alt="Subnets Tab">
</p>

## Groups

Groups create logical connections between services and hosts for topology visualization.

### Group Types

**Hub and Spoke**
- Central service with connections to multiple others
- Example: API gateway connected to microservices

- Create visual groupings
- Help document application architectures
- Organize complex network structures

### Managing Groups

**Creating a group**:
1. Navigate to **Manage > Groups**
2. Click **"Create Group"**
3. Select type (Hub and Spoke or Path)
4. Choose the central service (Hub and Spoke) or order services (Path)
5. Add related services
6. Save

**Editing a group**:

- **Mode**: Whether the daemon will pull work (discovery sessions to run or cancel) from the server, or the server will push work to the daemon
- **Created**: When the daemon was registered
- **Last Seen**: Timestamp of last successful heartbeat

### Daemon Capabilities

Each daemon reports its capabilities:

**Docker Socket Access**
- **True**: Can discover Docker containers
- **False**: Cannot access Docker socket

**Interfaced Subnets**
- Lists which subnets the daemon has network interfaces with
- The daemon will scan these subnets by default during network discovery

### Managing Daemons

**Viewing daemons**:
- Navigate to **Manage > Daemons**
- See all daemons and their capabilities
- Check last seen timestamps

**Creating a daemon**:
1. Click **"Create Daemon"**
2. Select target network
3. Click **"Generate Key"** to create API key
4. Copy the Docker Compose or binary command
5. Run it on your target host

See [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md#additional-daemons) for deployment instructions.

**Deleting a daemon**: Click the delete icon. You'll also need to uninstall the daemon from the host it's running on.

<p align="center">
  <img src="../media/daemons_tab.png" width="800" alt="Daemons Tab">
</p>

**Important**: Deleting a daemon does NOT delete discovered data. Hosts, services, and topology remain until explicitly deleted.

## API Keys

API keys authenticate daemons to the server. Each daemon requires one API key.

### API Key Properties

- **Name**: Custom identifier for the key
- **Network**: Which network this key grants access to
- **Created**: When the key was generated
- **Last Used**: Timestamp of last authentication
- **Expires At**: Optional expiration date
- **Enabled**: Whether the key is currently active

### Managing API Keys

**Viewing API keys**:
- Navigate to **Manage > API Keys**
- See all keys and their usage status

**Creating an API key**:
1. Go to **Manage > Daemons**
2. Click **"Create Daemon"**
3. Click **"Generate Key"**
4. The key is automatically created and assigned to the network

Alternatively:
1. Go to **Manage > API Keys**
2. Click **"Create API Key"**
3. Select target network
4. Set optional expiration
5. Save and copy the key (it won't be shown again)

**Disabling an API key**:
1. Click on the key card
2. Toggle **"Enabled"** to off
3. Save

Disabled keys cannot authenticate, but can be re-enabled later.

**Deleting an API key**: Click the delete icon. Any daemons using this key will stop authenticating and stop working.

<p align="center">
  <img src="../media/api_keys_tab.png" width="800" alt="API Keys Tab">
</p>

### Security Best Practices

- Create separate API keys for each daemon
- Use expiration dates for temporary deployments
- Disable unused keys rather than deleting them
- Rotate keys periodically for production environments
- Never share keys in public repositories or logs

## Discovery

Discovery is the process of scanning your network to find hosts and services.

### Discovery Types

**Self-Report**
- Daemon reports its own capabilities
- Identifies Docker socket access
- Lists interfaced subnets
- Runs automatically on daemon startup

**Network Scan**
- Scans IP addresses on configured subnets
- Detects open ports
- Identifies services via pattern matching
- Performs reverse DNS lookups
- Collects MAC addresses (for directly connected subnets)

**Docker**
- Connects to Docker socket on daemon's host
- Discovers running containers
- Maps container names and metadata
- Detects containerized services
- Identifies internal Docker networks

### Run Types

**AdHoc (On Demand)**
- Manual execution only
- Use for testing or one-time scans
- Triggered from **Discover > Sessions**

**Scheduled (Automatic)**
- Runs on a cron schedule
- Default: Hourly (`0 0 */1 * * *`)
- Can be customized to any cron expression
- Enable/disable without deleting

### Creating a Discovery

1. Navigate to **Discover > Scheduled**
2. Click **"Create Discovery"**
3. **Details**:
   - Enter a name (e.g., "Daily Network Scan")
   - Select the daemon to execute the discovery
4. **Type**:
   - Choose discovery type (Network, Docker, or Self-Report)
   - For Network: Select subnets to scan. You can add subnets that the daemon doesn't have a direct interface with, and it will try to reach IP addresses on that subnet as well.
   - For Docker/Self-Report: Automatically uses daemon's host
5. **Schedule** (optional):
   - Choose AdHoc or Scheduled
   - For Scheduled: Set cron schedule or use preset intervals
6. Save

### Running a Discovery

**Manual execution**:
1. Navigate to **Discover > Sessions**
2. Find your discovery in the scheduled list
3. Click the **"Run"** button
4. Monitor progress in real-time

**Scheduled execution**:
- Scheduled discoveries run automatically at their configured time
- View the "Last Run" timestamp in the scheduled discoveries list

### Monitoring Discovery

**Real-time progress**:
- Navigate to **Discover > Sessions**
- Active scans show live progress updates
- See scanned count vs. discovered count
- Watch as hosts and services are found

**Discovery history**:
- Completed discoveries appear in the history list
- View duration, start/end times, and results
- Filter by daemon or network

<p align="center">
  <img src="../media/discovery_sessions.png" width="800" alt="Discovery Sessions">
</p>

### Discovery Duration

For benchmarking, 1x /24 subnet (256 IP addresses) takes 5-10 minutes to scan in full.

Factors affecting speed:
- Number of IP addresses to scan
- Subnet mask size (smaller masks = more IPs)
- Concurrent scans setting (default: 15)
- Network response times

### Host Naming

When discovering hosts, NetVisor determines names using this priority:

1. Hostname from reverse DNS, if available
2. If **BestService** is set - will use the first named service identified on the host. If **IP** is set, will use the host's IP address
3. If option 2 didn't produce a name, will use the remaining fallback (ie **IP** if **BestService** was set)

Configure this per-discovery in the discovery type settings.

## Topology Visualization

The topology view generates an interactive diagram of your network structure.

## Multi-VLAN Setup

To map networks across multiple VLANs, deploy additional daemons or select additional subnets in **Discovery > Scheduled**.

### Why Multiple Daemons?

Adding subnets to a scan works, but the daemon isn't guaranteed to be able to reach those subnets depending on your network firewall and other configurations, and it won't be able to get MAC Addresses or Hostnames from DNS.

For isolated VLANs:
- Deploy one daemon per VLAN
- Each daemon scans its local network segment
- Server merges data into unified topology

### Deployment Strategy

**Option 1: Daemon per VLAN (Recommended)**

1. Identify your VLANs:
   - Production (192.168.1.0/24)
   - IoT (192.168.2.0/24)
   - Guest (192.168.3.0/24)

2. Deploy a daemon on each network:
   - Place a host on each VLAN (or use a router/firewall with access)
   - Install daemon following [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md#additional-daemons)
   - Configure with appropriate network ID

3. Run discoveries:
   - Each daemon scans its local VLAN
   - Server consolidates results automatically

**Option 2: Configure Subnets Daemon Can Reach**

If your daemon can route to multiple VLANs (e.g., it's on a management network):

1. Create subnets for each VLAN in **Manage > Subnets**
2. Create a Network Scan discovery in **Discover > Scheduled**
3. Select all reachable subnets
4. Run the discovery

**Note**: Without direct interface, the daemon cannot collect MAC addresses or hostnames via DHCP.

### Handling Duplicate Hosts

Devices appearing on multiple VLANs may be discovered as separate hosts. Use the [Consolidate Hosts](#consolidating-hosts) feature to merge them:

1. Identify the duplicate hosts (same device, different IPs)
2. Select the primary host to keep
3. Click **"Consolidate"**
4. Select the duplicate(s) to merge
5. Confirm

The primary host will have interfaces on all VLANs.

## FAQ

### Is IPv6 supported?

Not currently. IPv6 support is planned for future releases:

**Planned features**:
- Collecting and displaying IPv6 addresses during discovery
- Manual entry of IPv6 addresses when editing hosts
- IPv6 connectivity testing for known hosts

**Not planned**:
- Full IPv6 subnet scanning (would take too long for /64 networks)

If you need IPv6 support sooner, [open an issue](https://github.com/mayanayza/netvisor/issues/new) describing your use case.

### How do I contribute?

We welcome contributions! See [contributing.md](contributing.md) for:
- Adding service definitions (great first contribution!)
- Reporting bugs
- Requesting features
- Submitting pull requests

Join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/b7ffQr8AcZ) for help and discussions.

Update `NETVISOR_INTEGRATED_DAEMON_URL` to match if using the integrated daemon.

See [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md) for more options.

### How do I backup my data?

NetVisor stores all data in PostgreSQL. To backup:

**Docker setup**:
```bash
# Backup
docker exec netvisor-db pg_dump -U postgres netvisor > netvisor_backup.sql

# Restore
docker exec -i netvisor-db psql -U postgres netvisor < netvisor_backup.sql
```

**Manual setup**: Use standard PostgreSQL backup tools (pg_dump, pg_restore).

### How do I reset my password?

Currently, password resets must be done directly in the database:

1. Generate a new password hash using bcrypt
2. Update the `users` table with the new hash
3. Or, ask another Owner to delete and re-invite you

Self-service password reset is planned for a future release.

### Why is my topology empty after discovery?

Check these common issues:

1. **Discovery failed**: View **Discover > Sessions** for errors
2. **Wrong network selected**: Check topology options panel for network filter
3. **All services hidden**: Check if service category filters are too aggressive
4. **No hosts found**: Verify daemon can reach the network

See [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md#troubleshooting) for more troubleshooting steps.
